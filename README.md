## Running the asispectralinversion library

Runscript using example data can be found in src/asispectralinversion/asispectralinversion_runscript.py -- tweak inputs like your output directory and where you have ASI data/GLOW lookup tables saved, as in the following template:

```
# Tweakable inputs
date = 'YYMMDD' # date in the form of YYYYMMDD
starttime = 'HHMMSS' # start time in the format of HHMMSS
endtime = 'HHMMSS' # end time in the format of HHMMSS

maglatsite = 65.8 # site of camera in magnetic latitude

lambdas = ['0428', '0558', '0630'] # wavelengths (nm) of imager filters

folder = '/path_to_GLOW_lookup_tables_for_hour/' # folder that holds all image files and GLOW outputs for an hour's worth of an event
base_outdir = '/path_to_output_directory/' # output directory to store all output figures and h5s
output_txt = '/path_to_output_directory/time_ranges.txt' # output for txt file that shows time cadence

# Main function calls to run through entire process
date, starttime, endtime, maglatsite, folder, base_outdir, lambdas = file_data(date, starttime, endtime, maglatsite, folder, output_txt, base_outdir)
process_grouped_files(date, starttime, endtime, maglatsite, folder, base_outdir, lambdas)

```

Note that the required inputs are a date to pull PNG files for, a GLOW lookup table for the corresponding time(s), and a skymap.mat file. See instructions below for generating GLOW lookup tables and downloading the necessary skymap.mat file to go with each run.

6. An output file that shows the time between processed 2D maps in .csv format
   
7. Output files with mapped information to plug into external libraries (Lompe, GEMINI) in .h5 format


All maps are given in both geodetic and geomagnetic coordinates.


## Using this library to format maps to plug into GEMINI

The gemini_mapping.py script located in asispectralinversion/src/ takes the 2D maps achieved by running asispectralinversion_runscript.py and formats them in a way that the GEMINI model can use to generate model precipitation inputs.


## Obtaining GLOW Lookup Tables

GLOW lookup tables are required to perform the inversion.  These are generated by Fortran routines that are included in this repo.  The [NCAR GLOW](https://github.com/NCAR/GLOW) model is independently maintained, but has been added as a linked submodule so should be automatically included when cloning this repo.

You will need a [fortran compiler](https://fortran-lang.org/compilers/) to build this code.  If you do not already have a fotran compiler on your system, we recommend installing [gfortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/).

### Building Executable
Note: Presuming no changes in the look-up table source code, you should only have to do this part ONCE.  After the executables are build and available on your system, you can use all to generate all look-up tables regardless of time and locaiton.

1. Confirm that you have a [fortran compiler](https://fortran-lang.org/compilers/) installed on your system.

2. Enter the `glow_invert` source code directory.  From the root of this repo, run the following.
```
cd src/glow_invert
```

3. Run the `makefile` to generate the executables.  This can be done with the `make` command.
```
make tables airglow
```
This should generate the executables `glow_invert_tables.exe` and `glow_invert_airglow.exe`.

4. Make sure the shell script `generate_tables.sh` has execution permissions.  This can ususally be done by running
```
chmod +x generate_tables.sh
```

#### Troubleshooting
You may have to edit the makefile for it to work on your particular system.  For instance, by default the makefile specifies gfortran as the compiler with the line:
```
FC = gfortran
```
If you are using a different compiler, it will have to be specified here.  Some of the other flags and options listed in the makefile may also need to be customized for different systems.

If you are running the `make` command multiple times, it may be helpful to run `make clean` in between each build attempt to avoid attempting to build with mismatched compile options.

### Generate Lookup Tables
A new lookup table will need to be generated anytime the input paramters change.

1. Make sure you are in the `glow_invert` source code directory.
```
cd path/to/asispectralinversion/src/glow_invert
```
2. Copy `in.invert`.  This file can be stored anywhere on your system, but keep track of the full path.  It is often helpful to rename it with the event date as `in.invert.YYMMDD`

3. Modify your copy of `in.invert` to specify the appropriate parameters.  Parameters should be listed in a single row with white space seperating each.

   The following example is for a file for March 19, 2023 (assuming you name the file in.invert.<YYDOY>, in.invert.23078)

   - YYDOY: 23078
   - ut time (seconds): 29760
   - glat (degrees): 65.12
   - glon (degrees): 212.8
   - f10.7a (average solar flux): 159.9
   - f10.7 (solar flux for this particular day): 143.0
   - f10.7p (solar flux for the previous day): 140.0
   - Ap: 10.0
   - output directory: path/to/output/directory/for/lookup/tables

4. Run the shell script `generate_tables.sh` with your customized `in.invert` file as a command line argument to generate all lookup tables required for the ASI inversion code

```./generate_tables.sh path/to/in.invert```

   Depending on your machine, this may take a while. It takes my machine about 20 minutes to generate one set oftables.

5. Check your output directory (specified in in.invert)

   There should be 11 files that are generated and stored in this folder, pluss the subfolder `airglow` with 11 more files contained within:

   - edens3d_23078_29760.bin
   - eta4278_23078_29760.bin

## Obtaining the skymap.mat file

For all runs specifically with the Poker DASC (which this repo is supporting), the same skymap.mat file will be used for every single run. It can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Hayley%20Clevenger/GLOW). If the DASC gets moved at all, the skymap.mat file contents will change and the new version will be needed for the relevant dates.
